==========

There is no necessity of triggering any services or broadcasting messages manually to block the UI. The module takes care of it. The module makes use of response interceptor to block your UI as your http requests are made and completed.

## Installation

AngularJS is required to run this module.


Inject the module to the app.
```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['ngBlockui']);
```

Add this to your html head.
Note: Path to the css and javascript varies.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blockui.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ngBlockui.js"></script>
```

Add a
```
<div ng-class="{blockui:blockUI==true}">
```
to the body of your index.html. All the webpage code must come under this div as shown below
```
<body>
	<div ng-class="{blockui:blockUI==true}">
		//your code
	</div>
</body>
```

(or if you are using route services)

```
<div ng-class="{blockui:blockUI==true}">
	<div ng-view></div>
</div>
```

Yep!.. That's it. You're done with blocking the UI !
